# Budget Optimizer — Plain-Language Explanation

> **What it does:** Takes a user's available money and distributes it across spending categories in the best possible way, respecting their constraints and preferences.

---

## In one sentence

The Budget Optimizer is a mathematical planner that figures out how to split a user's money across categories like food, transport, bills, and savings — doing the best job possible while following the rules the user sets.

---

## Why it exists

Most people know roughly how much they earn and what they spend on, but they struggle with the *allocation problem*: given ₱30,000 this month, how much should go to food vs. transport vs. savings vs. debt repayment? The optimizer solves this by treating it as a formal mathematical problem — finding the best possible split given real constraints.

---

## Key concept: This is NOT a learned model

Unlike the other three models, the Budget Optimizer has **no training phase** and **no machine learning**. It's a **deterministic mathematical optimization** — a linear program solved by `scipy.optimize.linprog` (using the HiGHS solver). The same inputs always produce the same outputs. This makes it fast, transparent, and fully explainable.

---

## Input — What goes in

The optimizer receives a structured request with these components:

### 1. Available funds

The total money available for allocation this period (e.g., ₱30,000 for this month). This is the user's income minus any already-committed amounts.

### 2. Categories with restrictions

Each spending category (food, transport, bills, savings, etc.) has:

| Field | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Restriction level** | One of three levels (see below). |
| **Floor** | Minimum amount that MUST go to this category. |
| **Ceiling** | Maximum amount that CAN go to this category. |
| **Current spend** | How much has already been spent in this category so far. |
| **Priority weight** (0–1) | How important is it to the user that this category gets its preferred amount? |

### 3. Target ratios

The user's *preferred* spending proportions — e.g., "I want 40% on food, 20% on transport, 15% on savings." These are goals, not hard rules; the optimizer tries to get as close as possible.

### 4. Optional context

- Transaction history (for context).
- Forecast data (so the optimizer can plan ahead).
- A flag for whether to include reasoning in the response.

## The three restriction levels — What they mean

| Level | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **LOCKED** | Fixed amount. Floor = ceiling = current spend. Cannot change. | Rent already paid at ₱8,000 — it's locked in. |
| **PROTECTED** | Must receive at least the maximum of (floor, current spend). Can receive more. | Food: floor is ₱5,000, already spent ₱6,200 — must get at least ₱6,200. |
| **FREE** | Flexible. Must stay between floor and ceiling. | Entertainment: between ₱0 and ₱3,000, optimizer decides. |

## Process — How it thinks

### 1. Problem setup

The optimizer frames budget allocation as a **linear program** — a mathematical problem with:

- **Decision variables**: One number per category (how much to allocate), plus one "deviation" variable per category (how far the allocation is from the target ratio).
- **Objective**: Minimize the total weighted deviation from the user's target ratios. Categories with higher `priority_weight` get penalized more for missing their target.
- **Constraints** (the rules it must follow):

| Constraint | Mathematical form | Plain meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Budget sum** | Σ allocations = available funds | Every peso must be allocated somewhere. |
| **LOCKED** | Allocation = current spend | Locked categories get exactly what they've already spent. |
| **PROTECTED** | Allocation ≥ max(floor, current spend) | Protected categories can't get less than what's already committed. |
| **FREE** | floor ≤ allocation ≤ ceiling | Free categories stay within their bounds. |
| **Deviation** | deviation ≥ allocation − target AND deviation ≥ target − allocation | Deviation captures the absolute gap between what was allocated and what was desired. |

### 2. Solving

The problem is passed to `scipy.optimize.linprog` with the **HiGHS** solver — a fast, production-grade linear programming solver. It finds the allocation that minimizes total deviation while satisfying all constraints.

### 3. Feasibility check

Not all requests can be satisfied. The optimizer reports one of three states:

| State | What it means |
|---|---|
| **FEASIBLE** | All constraints can be met simultaneously. The solution is optimal. |
| **REDUCED** | The original request was infeasible (e.g., required minimums exceed available funds), so the optimizer **relaxed some constraints** to find the best possible allocation. The user is told what changed. |
| **INFEASIBLE** | No valid allocation exists, even with relaxation. The user needs to adjust their inputs (increase funds, lower floors, etc.). |

---

## Output — What comes out

The API returns a structured recommendation:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Allocations** (list) | For each category: the recommended amount, floor, ceiling, target, and how much deviation was accepted. |
| **Budget utilization** (0–1) | What fraction of available funds is allocated (ideally 1.0). |
| **Constraint satisfaction** (0–1) | What fraction of constraints are fully met (1.0 = all constraints satisfied). |
| **Feasibility status** | `FEASIBLE`, `REDUCED`, or `INFEASIBLE`. |
| **Per-category explanations** | A plain-language reason for each allocation: "Food received ₱12,000 (target was ₱12,000 — exact match)" or "Transport was reduced to ₱4,500 to stay within available funds." |
| **Overall explanation** | A summary of the allocation strategy. |

### Example output

```
Status: FEASIBLE
Available funds: ₱30,000
Utilization: 100%
Constraint satisfaction: 100%

Allocations:
  Food:         ₱12,000  (target ₱12,000, deviation: 0)     ← exact match
  Transport:    ₱ 6,000  (target ₱ 6,000, deviation: 0)     ← exact match
  Bills:        ₱ 8,000  (LOCKED — matches current spend)    ← no choice
  Savings:      ₱ 3,000  (target ₱ 4,500, deviation: ₱1,500) ← reduced to fit
  Entertainment:₱ 1,000  (target ₱ 1,500, deviation: ₱  500) ← reduced to fit

Explanation: All constraints satisfied. Savings and Entertainment
were slightly reduced from their target ratios to accommodate the
locked Bills allocation, but stayed within their allowed bounds.
```

## How other modules use this

- **Forecasting** provides the estimated category-level spending that feeds into the optimizer's `current_spend` and `ceiling` values.
- **Anomaly Detector** can flag transactions that deviate from the optimizer's plan ("You've overspent in Food by ₱2,000 relative to your budget").
- **PFP Classifier** informs initial restriction levels — an "At-Risk" user may have tighter LOCKED/PROTECTED constraints, while a "Tolerant" user gets more FREE categories.
- **User dashboard** displays the allocation as a visual budget card, with real-time tracking of how actual spending compares to the plan.

## Evaluation

The optimizer was evaluated on **600 synthetic personas** with varying income levels, obligation loads, and preference profiles:

| Metric | Value | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Constraint Satisfaction Rate | 1.0 (100%) | When the problem is feasible, every constraint is met. |
| Budget Utilization Rate | 1.0 (100%) | Every peso of available funds is allocated. |
| Mean deviation from preferences | 0.041 (4.1%) | On average, allocations are within ~4% of the user's target ratios. |

Of the 600 personas: **541 were FEASIBLE** (90.2%), **59 were INFEASIBLE** (9.8%) — meaning about 1 in 10 synthetic users requested allocations that couldn't be fully satisfied with their available funds.

---

## Honest limitations

- **No learning** — the optimizer doesn't improve over time or learn from past allocations. It's a pure mathematical solver. Any improvements come from better inputs (more accurate forecasts, better category definitions) rather than model updates.
- **Linearity assumption** — the model assumes that spending relationships are linear (doubling the budget doubles each category equally). In reality, some categories have thresholds (you need at least ₱X for transport, but beyond that, more doesn't help).
- **No temporal awareness** — the optimizer allocates for one period at a time. It doesn't plan across months (e.g., "save more this month for a big expense next month").
- **INFEASIBLE outcomes** require user intervention — the optimizer can't create money that isn't there. When constraints conflict with available funds, the user must adjust their expectations.
