# Odin-ML — Agent Guide

**Thesis**: Development of BUDI: A Personalized Intelligent Finance Management Application for Filipinos Using Classification, Forecasting, Optimization, and Anomaly Detection Models for Improving Savings and Debt
**Group 4, III-DCSAD, University of Makati**

---

## Repository Role

This repository contains the **machine learning service** for the BUDI application: the FastAPI microservice (`app/`), the model training pipeline (`training/`), and their tests. It does **not** contain thesis documents (those live in **Odin-Paper**) or the RRL corpus (that lives in **Odin-Literature**).

---

## Coding Standards

| Standard | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| Repository standards (Python/ML) | `docs/standards/REPOSITORY-STANDARDS.md` |
| Shared documentation format | `docs/standards/documentation-format.md` |
| Git commit message standards | `docs/standards/git-commit-standards.md` |

**Note:** This repository is a Python/FastAPI service. The frontend/TypeScript standards that apply to the main `odin` application repository do **not** apply here. Keep Python/ML-specific rules in `docs/standards/REPOSITORY-STANDARDS.md`.

---

## Repository Access and Collaboration

- `Odin` and `Odin-QA` are **read-only** to this agent. Do not modify, commit, or delete files in them.
- `Odin-ML` is fully writable.

## Navigation

| Document | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `INDEX.md` | Master index. Authoritative navigation for all files. |
| `README.md` | Project overview, setup, pipeline, and usage. |
| `app/` | FastAPI service code. Entry point: `app/main.py`. |
| `models/` | Final model artifacts + `metadata.json` for the new scope. |
| `training/` | Model training pipeline (scripts, datasets, artifacts). |
| `training/docs/` | ML design documents (data collection, EDA, dimension discovery) + `phases/` runbooks (7–10). |
| `tests/` | Pytest coverage for the service. |
| `docs/standards/` | Enforceable engineering and documentation standards. |
| `docs/models/` | Model candidate roster and model-lifecycle guidance. |

## Python Environment

- Runtime pinned by `.python-version` (Python 3.14.4).
- Install dependencies in a virtual environment only. Tooling config (lint/type/test) lives in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # test/dev deps
```

- Install the dev tooling selected by the project extras (or `pip install -e ".[dev]"` after adding a build backend).
- Use `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` on Windows PowerShell.

---

## Testing, Linting & Type Checking

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Also run (configured in `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
ruff check .                 # lint (E/F/W/I/B/UP/SIM/C4)
ruff format --check .        # format
mypy app                     # type check
```

Run the pre-commit hooks (if installed):

```bash
pre-commit install && pre-commit run --all-files
```

Tests live in `tests/` and cover the FastAPI service (health, PFP, forecast, anomaly, budget).

## Git Commit Message Standards

Use the format and conventions in `docs/standards/git-commit-standards.md`. This repository uses the `ml`, `api`, `data`, `training`, `docs`, `config`, `deps`, `tests`, and `standards` scopes.

---

## Important Gotchas

- Large generated artifacts (`training/datasets/`, `training/synth/`, `training/models/`, `training/figures/`) are gitignored. Only scripts, docs, and committed evaluation reports are tracked.
- The **top-level `models/` is NOT gitignored** — it is the canonical home for new-scope FINAL model artifacts + `metadata.json`.
- New-scope evaluation reports and winners land in top-level `models/<family>/` (committed, with `metadata.json`); containerization and CI/CD are still pending.
- `app/core/config.py` holds the service version; keep it in sync with release changes.
- The frontend standards in the main `odin` repository do not apply here. See `docs/standards/documentation-format.md` and `docs/standards/REPOSITORY-STANDARDS.md` for the Python/ML conventions that govern this repository.
